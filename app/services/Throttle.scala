// Throttle has two effects:
//
// * all requests that arrive concurrently (per VM) are forced to execute sequentially
//   (this is a consequence of waiting for an in-memory lock)
//
// * each request that uses the throttle only releases the shared lock after
//   a certain period of time has elapsed.
//
// The period of time taken to perform the request's work is computed from the
// sum of two factors
//
// 1. a fixed period cycle, including the time taken to do useful work.
//
// 2. an elastic back-off based on the actual time taken multiplied by some factor.
//
// Either of these can be disabled by setting to zero by their configuration parameter.
